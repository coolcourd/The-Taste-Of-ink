This plugin is a fork of Hello Dolly but instead uses the lyrics from one of my favorite songs, The Taste of Ink by The Used.

== Description ==

This plugin was based on the Hello Dolly plugin that most plugin developers look at as a simple example of how to make a WordPress plugin.
I have chosen to fork this plugin to give me simple practice with coding wordpress plugins and put something in the repository.
If you are a fan of the used like I am I hope you enjoy this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. enjoy the used every time you load an admin page

**NOTE:** Though this plugin can, in theory, run alongside the **Hello Dolly** plugin that is active
by default in WordPress distributions, it is strongly discouraged since the two don't look nice
together. Please disable or uninstall **Hello Dolly** before using this plugin for best results.

== Changelog ==

1.0 first version submitted on 5/14/2018
